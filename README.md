Satellite Land Cover Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

A machine learning project that classifies satellite images into Forest, River, and Residential land cover types using engineered RGB image features and a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.

Final Model Accuracy: 96.76%

Project Overview

Satellite imagery is widely used for environmental monitoring, urban planning, agriculture, and disaster response. In this project, I built a complete machine learning pipeline that classifies satellite images into three land cover categories:

Forest
River
Residential

Instead of using deep learning, this project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of machine learning by extracting meaningful numerical features from images and training a traditional KNN classifier.

Dataset

This project uses a subset of the EuroSAT RGB satellite imagery dataset.

The raw dataset is not included in this repository to keep the project lightweight.

After downloading the dataset, place it inside the following directory:

data/
└── raw/
    └── eurosat_subset/
        ├── Forest/
        ├── River/
        └── Residential/

The processed feature dataset generated during preprocessing is included in:

Feature Engineering

Each 64 × 64 RGB satellite image was converted into numerical features:

Mean Red value
Mean Green value
Mean Blue value
Standard deviation of the Red channel
Standard deviation of the Green channel
Standard deviation of the Blue channel
Overall image brightness

These engineered features transformed each image into a numerical representation suitable for machine learning.

Training/Test Split

80% Training
20% Testing

Hyperparameter Testing

The following K values were evaluated:

K = 1
K = 3
K = 5
K = 7
K = 9
K = 11

The highest accuracy was achieved with K = 5.

Results

Overall Accuracy: 96.76%

Class	Precision	Recall	F1 Score
Forest	0.99	1.00	0.99
Residential	0.94	0.98	0.96
River	0.97	0.91	0.94

Feature visualization showed that Forest images formed a distinct cluster, while River images partially overlapped with both Forest and Residential classes due to mixed landscape characteristics.
